## docker study

This is a repository that follows [Docker 101 Tutorial](https://www.docker.com/101-tutorial).

I tested deployment on my own AWS server, since [Play with Docker](https://labs.play-with-docker.com/) is not working now.
+ I followed [AWS document](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/docker-basics.html) to install Docker on AWS EC2/Lightsail instance.
